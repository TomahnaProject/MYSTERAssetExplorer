NOTES
Using Rev nodes in node viewer will blow up

IMPROVEMENTS TO REGISTRY EDITING
Saving/altering the registry refreshes the TreeView (collapsing all nodes - very annoying)
drop and drop actually changes the registry in memory, necessitating loading from disk to undo
NEEDS TO BE FIXED:
drag and drop should NOT be saved without explicitly done

IMPLEMENT:
Add Node
Extract Node
Extract All Child Nodes
Remove Node

Rename on Treeview

BLOWS UP WHEN TRYING TO SEND REV IMAGES TO NODE VIEWER

WOULD BE NICE:
fix file tree anchor cuz of filter checkbox
would be nice to see only small as well
definitely switch to cube faces when possible

add brightness setting for export
implement jobs for batching
drag and drop from file explorer to node viewer
pressing down on node viewer tree view would load next node
Jobs/operations for stuff like batch export
CUBE FACE ONLY CHECKBOX ON FILE EXPLORER

sorting on columns in File Explorer
move Nodes Details to right side
put image name on lable on node viewer
node viewer should be scalable
right click in node viewer should have remove option
should indicate node is altered/needs saving

Alphabetize Registery tree

rename "Node Identity" to Node Details

way to customize Cubemap Format
way to export Equirectangular
