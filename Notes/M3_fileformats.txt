FILES ASSOCIATED WITH MYST3:

.m3a = main data archive (cubemap jpgs, spotitem jpgs, bink videos, watermasks, tiny unknown files)
.m3r = resource archive (cursor bmps, small binks for UI purposes, Archetype and XET files)
.m3o = resource archive for patches (v. 101) (mainly a handful of jpgs)
.m3t = localized assets (images and text for subtitles)
.m3u = localized UI archive

.m3s = binary save format

with the exception of the .m3s these are all the same type of file (the myst 3 archive file) with different extensions

a myst3 archive file has a header containing a listing of all the archive's files, their offset, size, and if appropriate, metadata, and containing directory

the archive header is usually encrypted (as far as I can tell only the LEET node archive is not encrypted)

.m3s is presumably a straight binary file, and must be read by code aware of the meaning and placement of the values

The RSRC (Resource) archive has some interesting sub files:

- ARCHETYPE file is an ASCII text file and is a sort of database / object schema

- XET files are odd. There are 7 of them. They all start with XET, and have a small header.
The data that follows seems to contain data in blocks. Each file has a single block size, but different files have different block sizes.
unknown what the data actually contains/ is used for (perhaps data for audio/music sequences? cannot find where that data lives)
