Important Issues:
- m3a bink files not ripped correctly
- need to get ogg files out of sb0 files
- run extraction on separate thread to prevent UI blocking

- last m4b in nested m4b doesn't seem to be indexed correctly (waternight.m4b or something has blank contents)
- shared and common .m4b wrong format, at the least make more clear they fail to open (since may not be able to figure out how to open)
- some m4bs aren't correctly formatted -- need a better way to handle them / display them (they should be extractable themselves if not openable)

Nit-picks
- double clicking folder in file explorer should open that folder (in folder explorer & file explorer)


Questions:

- an M4B CAN have both files and subfolders in the same directory.
DragonUnpacker seemed to work on the assumption that a folder had one or the other. Need to confirm DUP was neglecting to show certain files
