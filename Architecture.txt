may want to arrange the core so it has core level interfaces (so like IVirtualFile)

problem with the lookup service is that it wants virtual file index, and I can't return a tileset
plus there is the issue of a m4b file being both a folder and file, how would extraction work?



may want to have a division in the core:

- model (classes defining packets of data) 
- operations (classes defining packets of abilities)

so an m3a indexing operation could then be uses by a generic indexing service

I might be overthinking/overengineering here
